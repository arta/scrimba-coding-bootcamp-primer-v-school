            <h2>What is DOM?</h2>
            <p>DOM, Document Object Model, is a representation of the document, the html & css (anElement.style), accessible to JS, essentially an API, for manipulations triggered by user's actions with the document.</p>
            <h2>Assignment:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Outside of Scrimba (in an editor like Visual Studio Code), build a basic HTML page from scratch (no copy/pasting!)</li>
                <li>Try to do so without looking at any past work if you can.</li>
                <li>Connect a JavaScript file to the page</li>
                <li>Log the `document` to the console. (Shows up as <> in Scrimba)</li>
                <li>Open the HTML page in a browser (can simply double click the file on your computer OR use the Live Server VS Code
                extension), open the developer tools, navigate to the "console" portion of the developer tools, and look what
                actually got logged to the console.</li>
                <li>Try using `console.dir` as well.</li>
            </ul>
