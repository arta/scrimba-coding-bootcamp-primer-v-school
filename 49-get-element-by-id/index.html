            <ul>
                <li>Outside of Scrimba (VS Code or another editor), create another HTML page from complete scratch (no cheating!) and
                connect a JS file to it</li>
                <li>Create an %h1 element and give it an ID, but don't put any text inside</li>
                <li>In JavaScript, select your %h1 element and give it some text
                    <ul><li>You may likely have to look up how to do this. This is a great chance to practice using Google for finding
                    answers to your coding questions!</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>Open your HTML page in a browser and check if your text shows up!
                    <ul><li>If you're using VS Code, you can use the Live Preview extension to quickly open the HTML file in a browser.</li></ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once you're ready, move on to the next lesson in the playlist! And remember, you can always ask questions in the
            Module 0 Slack workspace if you run into issues. If you haven't joined that yet, here's the link again:</p>
